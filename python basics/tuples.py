# Define a tuple
# Tuples have many of the same properties as lists. The biggest difference is immutibility
# Tuples have a different syntax (defined with parenthesis)



my_tuple = (1,2,3,1)

print my_tuple

# Figure out the index value of a value in my tuple
print my_tuple.index(1)

# Determine how often a value shows up in my tuple
print my_tuple.count(1)
