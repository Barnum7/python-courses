# from __future__ import division
# This line above imports the division module from python 3.

print 3 + 2
print 3 * 2
print 3 - 2
print 3 / 2 #This symbol performs 'classic' division' which means the decimals are truncated off. This is not the case in python 3
print 3.0 / 2 #Defining one of the numbers as a float makes python 2 perform true division
print 3 / 2.0 #Defining one of the numbers as a float makes python 2 perform true division
print float(3) / 2 #Or you can use the float function to make an integer a float

print 2**3 #2 to the power of 3
print 4 ** 0.5 #This is the same as working out the square root

print 2 + 10 * 10 + 3 #python follows order of operations. So this will be 105
